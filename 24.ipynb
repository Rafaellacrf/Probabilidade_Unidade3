But whether or not it's theoretically sound to compute the mean for ordinal variables is contentious. Below we explore one argument against computing the mean, and in the next section we'll explore an argument that supports the idea of using the mean.\n","\n","Remember from the previous course that if two data points are measured on an ordinal scale and there's a difference between them, we can tell the direction of the difference, but we don't know the size of the difference.\n","\n","<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WD9RZE-JqdOBPkFS-CEqNuxmDms-S6Yp\">\n","\n","If the overall condition of a house is rated with an 8 (Very good), and another house gets a 4 (Below average), we can't say that the conditions of the former are twice as better than the latter. The most we can say is that the house which got an 8 has better conditions (we can't quantify how much better — it could be twice as better, three times as better, 1.5 times as better, we simply don't know).\n","\n","This should be more clear if we consider the fact that the numbers used to encode the quality levels (\"Poor\", \"Fair\", \"Good\", etc.) are chosen arbitrarily. Instead of numbers from 1 to 10, we could have numbers from 30 to 40, or from 50 to 70 in steps of 2, or from 0 to 9:\n","\n","\n","| Code | Quality        |\n","|------|----------------|\n","| 0    | Very poor      |\n","| 1    | Poor           |\n","| 2    | Fair           |\n","| 3    | Below average  |\n","| 4    | Average        |\n","| 5    | Above average  |\n","| 6    | Good           |\n","| 7    | Very good      |\n","| 8    | Excellent      |\n","| 9    | Very excellent |\n","\n","\n","Inside the framework of a 0-9 system, an \"Excellent\" label would be encoded as a 8, and a \"Below average\" as a 3. If we took ratios, we'd reach different conclusions for different encoding systems:\n","  - For a 1-10 encoding system, the conditions of an \"Excellent\" (9) house would be 2.25 times as better than those of a \"Below average\" (4) house ($\\frac{9}{4}=2.25$).\n","For a 0-9 encoding system, the same \"Excellent\" (8) house would have conditions that are 2.67 times as better than the conditions of a \"Below average\" (3) house ($\\frac{8}{3}=2.67$). \n","\n","It can be argued thus that the numerical values of an ordinal variable are not subject to meaningful arithmetical operations. But computing the mean involves meaningful arithmetical operations, so it's not theoretically sound to use the mean for ordinal variables.\n","\n","Because the median doesn't involve arithmetical operations, it's considered a better alternative to the mean. This doesn't fully apply, however, to even-numbered distributions, where we need to take the mean of the middle two values to find the median. This poses some theoretical problems, and we'll see in the next mission that the **mode** might be a better choice in this case as a measure of average.\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","- Find the **mean** and the **median** of the **Overall Cond** variable.\n","  - Assign the **mean** to a variable named **mean**.\n","  - Assign the **median** to a variable named **median**.\n","- Plot a histogram to visualize the distribution of the **Overall Cond** variable.

The truth is that in practice many people get past the theoretical hurdles and use the mean nonetheless because in many cases it's much richer in information than the median.\n","\n","Let's consider a situation where the mean is arguably a much better choice to measure the average of an ordinal variable. Let's say we're working for an online real estate company which allows customers to buy, sell, and rent houses. The speed on our website is important for all of our customers, and we want to measure how the customers perceive the speed on the website.\n","\n","We sample randomly 10 customers and have them assess the following sentence: \"The website is very fast, usually a new page loads in less than a second\".

The mean, however, went up to 3, suggesting that the changes our engineers made have had a positive effect. Unlike the median, the mean is sensitive to small changes in the data, and this property is what makes it more useful in this case.\n","\n","It should be clear by now that whether we should use the mean for ordinal data is contentious. In practice, you should be flexible and make your choice on a case by case basis. Also, you are not constrained to choose one metric or the other — you can choose both the mean and median to describe a distribution."]},{"metadata":{"id":"aJvKm5S_Pbow","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 9 - Next steps"]},{"metadata":{"id":"5DAFGPc2RFdQ","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In this mission, we learned about the weighted mean and the median.

For ordinal data, if we encode the attributes with numbers it becomes possible to compute the mean, but this is contentious and raises theoretical issues.\n","\n","In the next mission, we continue the discussion about finding averages for ordinal data and also learn new things, like finding the average value for nominal variables.\n"]}]}
